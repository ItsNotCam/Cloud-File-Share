## Overview

This document outlines the design of my Google Drive clone. The project aims to **replicate the fundamental features of Google Drive**. These features include file uploading, and file access management between users. Developed with TypeScript, NodeJS, NextJS, ReactJS, and MySQL, the entire **application is containerized for easy deployment using Docker Compose.**

## Tech Stack
* The frontend is built using **ReactJS with TypeScript**, assisted by NextJS's server side functions and SSR.
* **NodeJS and NextJS** work together to form the backend - these manage **user authentication, file handling, and file access control**
* **MySQL** is used to store **user information, file metadata, access permissions, and comments.**

## Containerization

The entire application is **containerized using Docker** and can be deployed easily using **Docker Compose**. The services include a **MySQL container** and a custom-made **NodeJS container**.

## Features

* **File Uploading** - Users can upload files through the user interface - only the original uploader may delete the file permanently, other users may simply revoke their own access
* **Access Management** - Users can grant and revoke access to their files with other users
